## Probabilistic Graphical Models
Implementations of Mean Field Approximation (MFA) and Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) in `python3` using `pgmpy`. IPython notebooks are used for experiments and comparisons for the two algorithms.


MFA approximates the target distribution with an assumption that all variables are independent. LBP uses a Bethe cluster graph for approximation.
